# Exercise-2

As described in [module-4](https://github.com/INFO-201/m4-git-intro), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine (if you haven't already).

In the space below, you'll provide some information about a terminal command you've learned thus far in the class. In particular, you should include the following:

### All About `cd`

The cd command is used to navigate between files on your computer.
It’s used in this context: `cd Folder/Folder/etc`

  - What does it do?
    - Allows you to find locations of files on your computer.
  - How does it work?
    - In order to see the files in the current folder, use `ls`
    - From among the options within the folder, use `cd FolderName` to navigate there.
    - `cd` works relatively: if you go into a folder, you can only go into folders within that folder.
    - In order to go back (higher up the “tree”), you can use `cd ..`
